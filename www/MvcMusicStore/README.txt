About
=====

Facadebook is a facade and abstraction layer for the Facebook C# SDK,
which can be found at http://facebooksdk.codeplex.com/ Use it if you
want to make your own adjustments or if you unit test your code.


Version handling
================

The library version will match the version of the Facebook C# SDK it
facades. Since the SDK uses a four block version number, the library
will not be able to add a build verison of its own, which means that
the 5.2.1.0 version for instance, will be used as long as it facades
the 5.2.1.0 version of the SDK.
