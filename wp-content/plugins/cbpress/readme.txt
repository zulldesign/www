CBPRESS provides ClickBank affiliates with a full marketplace updated through ClickBank's XML feed.  The plug-in allows for customized displays of ClickBank products and also custom products so affiliates can combine affiliate products across ClickBank and competing Affiliate networks. Custom categories can also be added to suit whatever niche you are promoting.  

In addition, ClickBank products may be customized with your own product descriptions and titles, and multiple display options are possible for your Marketplace from displaying all products, custom and ClickBank, or restricting display to only selected categories, to displaying only products that have custom titles or descriptions.  The custom lists feature allows you to highlight several products through a shortcode in your blog entry.
  
Product Thumbnails are now available in version 1.2.0 which ties into WordPress image manager. A comprehensive update of all ClickBank products and categories in the ClickBank Marketplace is available in this WordPress plug-in.
