For 2002, the Sport Premium and Convenience option packages are gone, and an in-dash CD player is newly standard. The 5 Series fits between BMW's smaller 3 Series and its flagship 7 Series sedan.<br><br>The 5 Series' appearance was freshened for 2001. Base models equipped with a 2.5-liter inline-six-cylinder engine are called 525i, while those fitted with a larger 3.0-liter inline-six are designated 530i. The 4.4-liter V-8 that powers the 540i sedan and wagon was given a boost this year to 290 horsepower. All 5 Series models are rear-drive, have side-impact airbags for the front seats and come with a curtain-type Head Protection System. Side-impact airbags for the rear seats are optional.<br><br>The high-performance M5 sedan, which is fitted with a 394-hp, 5.0-liter V-8 engine and a six-speed-manual gearbox, also is available. Other 5 Series models may be equipped with either a manual or automatic transmission.<br><br>Exterior<br>With a 111.4-inch wheelbase, the 5 Series fits into the full-size category by cars.com standards, though some observers consider it a midsize model. At 188 inches long overall, the 5 Series is slightly shorter than the Mercedes-Benz E-Class sedan and nearly 9 inches shorter than the Lexus LS 430. In appearance, the 5 Series closely resembles its smaller and larger mates, all of which sport BMW's familiar twin-kidney grille.<br><br>Interior<br>Seating is provided for five occupants. Front bucket seats have 10-way power adjustment for the driver. Standard equipment on all models includes remote keyless entry, a 10-speaker audio system, a power tilt/telescoping steering column, heated power mirrors and an alarm. The 540i sedan adds such extras as a moonroof, dual-mode automatic air conditioning and xenon high-intensity-discharge headlights.<br><br>Leather upholstery is standard in the 540i and optional in the 525i and 530i, which otherwise come with standard imitation-leather seating. All models can be equipped with an optional split, folding rear seatback and BMW's navigation system.<br><br>Under the Hood<br>The 525i uses a 184-hp, 2.5-liter inline-six-cylinder engine, while a 225-hp, 3.0-liter inline-six goes into the 530i. Topping the regular lineup, the 540i gets a 4.4-liter V-8 that now produces 290 hp — 8 hp more than last year's engine. Six-cylinder models are available with either a five-speed-automatic or five-speed-manual transmission. The 540i comes with a five-speed-automatic or six-speed-manual transmission.<br><br>The 540i actually costs more when fitted with a manual shift than with the automatic, but stick-shift versions come with a Sport Package that includes 17-inch tires and a tauter suspension. All 5 Series models are rear-drive only, unlike the smaller 3 Series, which offers all-wheel drive as an option.<br><br>Safety<br>Dual-stage front airbags deploy according to crash severity and whether occupants are buckled up. Side-impact airbags for the front seats and BMW's Head Protection System — which consists of curtain-type airbags that deploy to protect front-seat occupants — are standard. Side-impact airbags and head-protection curtains are optional for the rear seats. Standard safety features include antilock brakes, traction control and an electronic stability system that BMW calls Dynamic Stability Control. The optional Park Distance Control detects obstacles to the front and rear of the car while parking it.<br><br>Driving Impressions<br>BMW manages to mix big doses of both sport and luxury in the 5 Series models. Drivers can expect the precise maneuverability and control of a 3 Series, coupled with quite a few luxuries near the level of the big 7 Series. Although suspensions are undeniably firm, especially if the sedan is fitted with a Sport Package, ride comfort remains pleasant over most pavement surfaces.<br><br>Performance is reasonably energetic even with the smallest six-cylinder engine, but the V-8 unleashes a veritable torrent of strength for supremely confident highway operation. BMW appears to strive for symmetry in each of its models, so the dashboard and its easy-to-read gauges look about the same, regardless of the size of the sedan.","ItemOption1FieldName":"Color","ItemOption1":"Red=0.10/Silver=0.15","ItemOption1Required":true,"ItemOption1Type":"SELECT-ONE","ItemOption1Default":null,"ItemOption2FieldName":"Package","ItemOption2":"Sport Package=0.1","ItemOption2Required":false,"ItemOption2Type":"SELECT-ONE","ItemOption2Default":null,"ItemOption3FieldName":null,"ItemOption3":null,"ItemOption3Required":false,"ItemOption3Type":"SELECT-ONE","ItemOption3Default":null,"ItemOption4FieldName":null,"ItemOption4":null,"ItemOption4Required":false,"ItemOption4Type":"SELECT-ONE","ItemOption4Default":null,"ItemOption5FieldName":null,"ItemOption5":null,"ItemOption5Required":false,"ItemOption5Type":"SELECT-ONE","ItemOption5Default":null,"ItemOption6FieldName":null,"ItemOption6":null,"ItemOption6Required":false,"ItemOption6Type":"SELECT-ONE","ItemOption6Default":null,"ItemOption7FieldName":null,"ItemOption7":null,"ItemOption7Required":false,"ItemOption7Type":"SELECT-ONE","ItemOption7Default":null,"ItemImage":"530i.jpg","ItemImage2":null,"ItemImage3":null,"ItemImage4":null,"ItemImage5":null,"ItemImage6":null,"ItemWeight":0,"ItemCustom":null,"ItemCustom2":null,"ItemCustom3":null,"ItemCustom4":null,"ItemCustom5":null,"ItemCustom6":null,"ItemDisplayOrder":null,"ItemShipping":1.1,"ItemShipping2":1.2,"ItemHandling":1.3,"ItemTax":1.4,"ItemTaxTypeId":1,"ItemShippingTypeId":1,"ItemDiscountTypeId":2,"ItemDownload":"530i.jpg","ItemCount":3,"ItemDownloadFn":null,"ItemSelected":true,"ItemCustomName":null,"ItemCustomName2":null,"ItemCustomName3":null,"ItemCustomName4":null,"ItemCustomName5":null,"ItemCustomName6":null,"ItemButtonTypeId":1,"ItemSubscribeA1":0,"ItemSubscribeP1":0,"ItemSubscribeT1":null,"ItemSubscribeA2":0,"ItemSubscribeP2":0,"ItemSubscribeT2":null,"ItemSubscribeA3":0,"ItemSubscribeP3":0,"ItemSubscribeT3":null,"ItemSubscribeRecurring":false,"ItemSubscribeRecurringTimes":0,"ItemSubscribeReattempt":false},{"ItemId":5,"ItemNumber":"Rolls Royce 01","ItemName":"Corniche","ItemPrice":5,"ItemDescription":"If price is really no object, and you simply must have a hand-built luxury convertible, there's only one place to turn — to Rolls-Royce and its Corniche. It comes with a sticker price that reaches well past a third of a million dollars. Today's version of the Corniche convertible debuted early in 2000, but it was by no means the first soft-top model of that name from the British automaker. No details on changes to 2002 models have been announced.<br><br>Bentley, Rolls-Royce's sister marque, also turns out a handful of convertibles each year, under the Azure nameplate. Both the Corniche and Azure are related to Bentley's Continental R coupe. The Azure is structurally similar and costs less than the Corniche, but both are top-end motorcars.<br><br>For the time being, Bentley and Rolls-Royce retain their original ownership, and production continues in Crewe, England. But this will change on Jan. 1, 2003, when BMW takes over the management of Rolls-Royce and Volkswagen assumes ownership of Bentley. Until then, the company's current owners will produce, sell and service both marques worldwide.<br><br>Exterior<br>Rolls-Royce and Bentley models differ mainly in the appearance of their grilles, with Rolls displaying a statelier version. In addition, Rolls-Royce is nearly alone in putting whitewall tires on its 17-inch wheels. The Corniche is about 213 inches long and measures a few inches shorter than the Lincoln Town Car. Available in shades to match or contrast with the body color, the flush-fitting power top stows beneath a chrome cover on the rear deck.<br><br>Interior<br>The Corniche seats four occupants in sumptuous pleasure and simply exudes luxury — just as its predecessors always have. Connolly leather is the same sort used on the seats in the British House of Lords. Power front bucket seats have four-position memory settings, and a remote control unit lets backseat passengers operate the eight-speaker audio system. Despite the use of front bucket seats, the automatic transmission's gearshift lever is mounted on the steering column rather than on the floor.<br><br>Under the Hood<br>The Corniche runs on a turbocharged, 6.75-liter V-8 engine that produces 325 horsepower and mates with a four-speed-automatic transmission. <br><br>Safety<br>Antilock brakes, traction control and automatic ride control are standard.

Simple voice commands such as \"temperature 72 degrees\" set the automatic system in operation. All Jaguars come with free scheduled maintenance for the warranty period, which is four years or 50,000 miles.<br><br>Exterior<br>To create the S-TYPE, Jaguar blended traditional styling cues from the British company's heritage with modern mechanical components from Ford, its parent company. Though the S-TYPE is built from the basic architecture of Lincoln's LS, the kinship is masked by classic Jaguar design elements, including a heavily sculptured hood with a leaping cat ornament, a slim oval vertical-bar grille and four round headlights. In profile and at the rear end, Jaguar cues are also mixed with contemporary lines.<br><br>Measuring 191.3 inches long overall, the S-TYPE is a few inches shorter than the Lincoln LS and 6.5 inches shorter than Jaguar's XJ8 sedan.

The available V-8 is entirely different from Lincoln's engine offering — a 281-hp 4.0-liter power plant that is also installed in Jaguar's XJ Series sedans and the XK8 sports car.

But meanwhile, the Seville carries on with some important improvements. During the 2002 model year, the Seville will get a next-generation MagneRide system to ease the driving experience even further. Replacing the car's continuously variable road-sensing suspension system, MagneRide responds in 1 millisecond and is claimed to be 10 times faster than current systems on the market. <br>An advanced DVD-based navigation system is available, and an XM satellite radio arrives later in the season. The Seville wears revised Cadillac wreath-and-crest badging and gets an extended oil-change interval (beyond the typical three months or 3,000 miles). <br><br>Serving as Cadillac's primary export model, the front-drive Seville is 201 inches long, which is 6 inches shorter than the DeVille. Cadillac purposely keeps the Seville's body smaller partly because it is the company's main export model, and most European garages cannot hold a larger vehicle. The SLS (Seville Luxury Sedan) comes with a 275-horsepower, 4.6-liter V-8 engine, while the STS (Seville Touring Sedan) gets a 300-hp version of that engine. A Sport Package for the STS includes 17-inch tires rather than the standard 16-inchers, along with a firmer suspension. <br><br>The STS features optional voice-operated services such as navigation assistance, downloading and listening to e-mail, and serving as an infrared port for Palm Pilots and other personal digital assistants. As a safety feature, Web-browsing and e-mail capabilities do not function unless the car is stopped. <br><br>Exterior<br>Not much has changed in the Seville's overall appearance since its last redesign for the 1998 model year. Prior to its redesign, the Seville shared the same platform and basic construction as the Eldorado coupe. Unlike the rounded appearance of the DeVille, the redesigned Seville has a more angular profile. <br><br>The Seville rides on a 112.2-inch wheelbase and measures 201 inches long overall, which is 6 inches shorter than the DeVille. The Seville is 75 inches wide and less than 56 inches tall. <br><br>Interior<br>The Seville accommodates five passengers. Front bucket seats are standard and can be equipped with Cadillac's adaptive seating system. Ten air cells in the upholstery change pressure every 4 minutes or so to adapt the seat to its occupant and the way the passenger is sitting. <br><br>A navigation system with touchscreen controls and a 5-inch color display screen in the dashboard are optional. GM's OnStar communication system is standard and offers two premium services. The Personal Calling system permits hands-free, voice-activated calls from the car without an additional cellular phone contract. And Virtual Advisor, another voice-activated system, provides Internet-based information such as news headlines, sports scores, stock quotes and weather conditions. <br><br>Under the Hood<br>The Seville's 4.6-liter Northstar V-8 engine comes in two different ratings. It produces 275 hp in the SLS, while a 300-hp version goes into the STS. Both engines can run on regular fuel, but Cadillac recommends premium gasoline for the best performance and fuel economy. Each engine works with a four-speed-automatic transmission. <br><br>Safety<br>Both Seville models have antilock brakes, traction control and side-impact airbags for the front seats. StabiliTrak, GM's electronic stability system, is also standard. <br><br>Driving Impressions<br>The Seville has long been considered the sportier-handling Cadillac. A brief drive in a Seville equipped with the latest MagneRide system confirms the sport sedan's road-going credentials. Without impairing handling talents in any perceptible way, MagneRide yields a supremely satisfying highway experience — not quite as cushiony or gentle, but about as smooth as one can expect in an automobile that delivers such impressive control on the road. <br><br>With either engine, the Seville driver needs just a tap on the throttle to unleash vigorous responses, aided by a smooth-shifting automatic transmission.

Employing infrared, heat-sensing technology, Night Vision projects images of the road ahead and sends them via a head-up display onto the windshield. <br>In its current form, the DeVille has been the best-selling luxury sedan in the U.S. market. An advanced DVD-based navigation system is available for 2002, and an XM satellite radio will arrive later in the model year. The DeVille displays Cadillac's revised wreath-and-crest badging, and this model gains dual-stage airbags and express-up/down front windows. <br><br>A 4.6-liter V-8 engine produces 275 horsepower in the base and DHS models or 300 hp in the DTS sedan. The DHS and DTS sedans feature optional voice-operated services such as navigation assistance, downloading and listening to e-mail, and serving as an infrared port for Palm Pilots and other personal digital assistants. Web-browsing and e-mail capabilities are disabled unless the car is stopped. <br><br>Exterior<br>More rounded and bulky in appearance than DeVilles of the recent and distant past, the four-door sedan is 207 inches long overall — about the same length as the Buick Park Avenue and slightly shorter than the Lincoln Continental. Riding a 115.3-inch wheelbase, the DeVille is 74.4 inches wide and 56.7 inches tall. Cadillac does not offer whitewall tires, but some dealers can install a set for buyers who like the traditional look. <br><br>Interior<br>Regardless of the seating arrangement, DeVilles are known for offering space for taller passengers in the front and rear seats. The backseat has ample legroom even when the front seats are moved all the way back. <br><br>A split, front bench seat is standard on the base and DHS models. The DTS comes only with front buckets and a floor-mounted shift lever. The DeVille's trunk lid swings open 90 degrees, with a low liftover for easy loading. Cargo volume is 19.1 cubic feet, and the trunk has a wide, flat floor. A foursome's golf bags can fit inside easily. <br><br>GM's standard OnStar communication system can be fitted with two premium services. Personal Calling allows hands-free, voice-activated calls from the car without an additional cellular phone contract, while Virtual Advisor provides Internet-based information such as news headlines, sports scores, stock quotes and weather conditions through voice activation. With the infrared, heat-sensing technology, the optional Night Vision accessory uses a camera mounted in the grille to let the driver see three to five times farther than the headlamps can reach. <br><br>Under the Hood<br>The base Deville and DHS are equipped with Cadillac's 275-hp, 4.6-liter Northstar V-8 engine, while the DTS comes with a 300-hp version of that engine. Both power plants can run on regular fuel, but Cadillac recommends premium gasoline for the best performance and fuel economy. Each V-8 works with a four-speed-automatic transmission. <br><br>Safety<br>Night Vision detects other moving vehicles, humans and animals long before the naked eye can see them. This system alerts the driver by means of a black-and-white head-up display that projects images and sits in front of the windshield. An ultrasonic rear parking-assist system is optional. When the car is in Reverse, four sensors in the back bumper detect objects that are less than 5 feet away and give audible and visual warnings to the driver. <br><br>Side-impact airbags are standard for the front seats and come as optional equipment for the rear seat positions. The front airbag on the passenger side is designed to protect both the right-front and middle-front passengers. <br><br>Driving Impressions<br>This is a Cadillac in the old mode, but it comes packed with modern technology and gadgetry. Strong Northstar V-8 performance blends with admirable transmission operation in the smooth-functioning powertrain. Downshifts are prompt and certain, yet smooth and nearly gentle. From a standstill, the DTS practically leaps ahead, responding almost as effectively for passing and merging. But at certain speeds, response is a little less vigorous. <br><br>The DeVille handles with a light touch but doesn't feel as taut as some competitors, especially among the import brands. The easygoing, genteel ride isn't as woozy or floaty as Cadillacs of the past, though the driver may not feel entirely connected to the road at all times. The DeVille may seem as if it isn't fully in charge when the pavement is flawed. Many typical Cadillac owners won't find this to be a problem at all. <br><br>The DeVille promises plenty of room for people and cargo in a handsome interior. The seats are big and relatively soft, yet they're reasonably supportive. The dashboard instruments in the DTS are exceptionally easy to read. Engine noise is blissfully subdued and muted, and other sounds are minimal. Visibility is generally good, though the back window is a tad squat and massive rear roof pillars might limit the driver's view for parking and lane changes. The huge trunk has an easy liftover.","ItemOption1FieldName":null,"ItemOption1":null,"ItemOption1Required":false,"ItemOption1Type":"SELECT-ONE","ItemOption1Default":null,"ItemOption2FieldName":null,"ItemOption2":null,"ItemOption2Required":false,"ItemOption2Type":"SELECT-ONE","ItemOption2Default":null,"ItemOption3FieldName":null,"ItemOption3":null,"ItemOption3Required":false,"ItemOption3Type":"SELECT-ONE","ItemOption3Default":null,"ItemOption4FieldName":null,"ItemOption4":null,"ItemOption4Required":false,"ItemOption4Type":"SELECT-ONE","ItemOption4Default":null,"ItemOption5FieldName":null,"ItemOption5":null,"ItemOption5Required":false,"ItemOption5Type":"SELECT-ONE","ItemOption5Default":null,"ItemOption6FieldName":null,"ItemOption6":null,"ItemOption6Required":false,"ItemOption6Type":"SELECT-ONE","ItemOption6Default":null,"ItemOption7FieldName":null,"ItemOption7":null,"ItemOption7Required":false,"ItemOption7Type":"SELECT-ONE","ItemOption7Default":null,"ItemImage":"DeVille.jpg","ItemImage2":null,"ItemImage3":null,"ItemImage4":null,"ItemImage5":null,"ItemImage6":null,"ItemWeight":0,"ItemCustom":null,"ItemCustom2":null,"ItemCustom3":null,"ItemCustom4":null,"ItemCustom5":null,"ItemCustom6":null,"ItemDisplayOrder":null,"ItemShipping":1.1,"ItemShipping2":1.2,"ItemHandling":1.3,"ItemTax":1.4,"ItemTaxTypeId":1,"ItemShippingTypeId":1,"ItemDiscountTypeId":2,"ItemDownload":"DeVille.jpg","ItemCount":-1,"ItemDownloadFn":"deville.jpg","ItemSelected":true,"ItemCustomName":null,"ItemCustomName2":null,"ItemCustomName3":null,"ItemCustomName4":null,"ItemCustomName5":null,"ItemCustomName6":null,"ItemButtonTypeId":1,"ItemSubscribeA1":0,"ItemSubscribeP1":0,"ItemSubscribeT1":null,"ItemSubscribeA2":0,"ItemSubscribeP2":0,"ItemSubscribeT2":null,"ItemSubscribeA3":0,"ItemSubscribeP3":0,"ItemSubscribeT3":null,"ItemSubscribeRecurring":false,"ItemSubscribeRecurringTimes":0,"ItemSubscribeReattempt":false},{"ItemId":9,"ItemNumber":"Lexus 01","ItemName":"LS430","ItemPrice":9,"ItemDescription":"Redesigned for 2001 with more aerodynamic styling and a bigger V-8 engine than the previous LS 400, the full-size, rear-drive flagship sedan from Toyota's luxury division gets only a single new color, Platinum Blue Pearl, for 2002.

Rivals in the luxury league include the Audi A8, BMW 5 Series and 7 Series, Infiniti Q45, Jaguar XJ8 and Mercedes-Benz E-Class and S-Class. In addition to its abundant standard equipment, the LS 430 can be equipped with such additional comfort features as heating and cooling elements for the front seats, an air-suspension system with adaptive shock-absorber control, and reclining and heated rear seats with a massaging mode. It can also be equipped with the Lexus Link communication system, which is essentially General Motors' OnStar communication service but is staffed by Lexus personnel.<br><br>Even with a hefty base price of $54,980 (including the destination charge), adding some of those extras can cause the final cost of the LS 430 to escalate sharply.

Lower bodyside cladding, high-intensity-discharge headlights and fog lamps are standard. Lexus claims that with the available air suspension, its top sedan has a 0.25 coefficient of drag (a measure of a vehicle's resistance to the air through which it passes), which is the lowest of any sedan sold today.

Back in 1994, Dodge jolted the full-size pickup market with the launch of its bold new Ram, which conveyed something close to the imposing appearance of a long-haul semi. The lightest-duty member of the full-size Dodge pickup family gets a fresh \"big rig\" look for 2002 — though it's evolutionary rather than charting another new course. Dodge unveiled the new Ram 1500 at the Chicago Auto Show in February 2001.<br><br>The Ram 1500's huge grille is reminiscent of the one used on the Power Ram concept vehicle, and a subtle hood bulge helps set a muscular tone. SLT, SLT Plus and Sport versions of the basic Ram are on sale, with three different front-end appearances. Regular-cab and Quad Cab body styles are available, each with a larger cab than before — 3 inches longer, in fact, to yield greater interior space. Dodge claims that the regular cab's interior is the largest in its class. The Quad Cab Ram pickup has four conventional, front-hinged doors.<br><br>Two new engines and one carryover unit are offered. A new 3.7-liter Magnum V-6 that produces 35 horsepower more than the 3.9-liter it replaces is now standard. A new 4.7-liter Magnum V-8 replaces the previous 5.2-liter and develops 5 hp more than its predecessor. The 245-hp, 5.9-liter V-8 carryover engine also remains available.<br><br>Roof-mounted curtain-type airbags are optional; they are the first for a full-size pickup, according to Dodge. Power-adjustable brake and accelerator pedals are also optional. Dodge claims to have the biggest brakes and the largest standard wheel/tire combination in the full-size pickup class. Rams have higher payload ratings and towing capacities than before, aerodynamics have improved, and the pickups are said to suffer less wind noise.<br><br>Heavy-duty Ram 2500 and 3500 pickups continue unchanged for one more season in their prior form. They will be redesigned for the 2003 model year.<br><br><br>Exterior<br>Regular-cab and four-door Quad Cab body styles are available. The regular-cab Ram gets a 6.25-foot cargo bed, rides a 120.5-inch wheelbase and stretches 207.7 inches long overall. With an 8-foot bed, the Ram has a 140.5-inch wheelbase and an overall length of 229.7 inches. Quad Cab pickups can also be equipped with the two bed sizes. They come in two wheelbases, 140.5 and 160.5 inches, but the overall lengths of the Quad Cabs are 227.7 and 249.7 inches, respectively.<br><br>Ram SLT models have an all-chrome grille, while the SLT Plus gets a body-colored grille with chrome crosshairs. A body-colored grille with unique chrome billets in the center goes on the Ram Sport pickup. The Quad Cab's rear doors open to 85 degrees to ease access to the interior.<br><br>Windshields have a greater slope than those on the previous Ram bodies. The hood has a pronounced crown that “falls\" toward the front fenders, and the front doors are designed to overlap the windshield pillars. New rack-and-pinion steering has been installed. Seventeen-inch tires are standard, and 20-inch tires on polished-aluminum wheels are optional. Ram pickups have 9.5 inches of ground clearance and a suspension travel of 8.5 inches.<br><br>The maximum towing capacity for Quad Cab pickups has increased from 7,650 to 8,350 pounds. The maximum for regular cabs is now 8,660 pounds, vs. 7,950 pounds for previous Ram 1500 models. Quad Cab models have a maximum payload rating of 1,750 pounds.<br><br><br><br>Interior<br>The Ram's front seats hold three occupants in a 40/20/40 configuration. A center “business console” can hold a laptop computer and features fold-down dividers. The center portion offers under-cushion storage.<br><br>Quad Cab models can have an optional 60/40-split rear seat with cushions that fold up to create a tall storage area. An optional steel section under the rear seats can fold open to form a flat load floor.<br><br><br><br>Under the Hood<br>Two new engines are available, and a third is a carryover from the previous generation. The new 3.7-liter Magnum V-6 produces 215 hp (35 hp more than the prior 3.9-liter). Replacing the long-lived 5.2-liter V-8 is a new 240-hp, 4.7-liter Magnum V-8. The third power plant is a 245-hp, 5.9-liter V-8.<br><br>A five-speed-manual transmission is standard, and a new four-speed automatic is optional. When installed in a Ram with the 3.7-liter or 4.7-liter engine, the automatic transmission incorporates an alternate second-gear ratio that kicks in for towing and climbing. Dodge's four-wheel-drive system can be engaged “on the fly” using a floor-mounted transfer-case lever; an electronically controlled system is optional.<br><br><br><br>Safety<br>All-disc brakes and rear-wheel antilock brakes are standard on the 1500 series, but four-wheel ABS is optional. Child-seat tether anchors are installed in as many as five seating positions. A push-button switch that deactivates the passenger-side airbag is available in regular-cab Rams.<br><br><br><br>Driving Impressions<br>The Ram 1500 may be considered a light-duty truck, but it seems big in every way, including its reaction to bumps and holes. Although the suspension regains control fairly quickly, city driving creates quite a bit of jolting — enough to make even a short journey taxing. The ride improves on the highway, but an unloaded Ram still tends to move around a lot.<br><br>The Ram 1500 is easy to drive and steer. It responds quite predictably to driver inputs, producing no big or bad surprises. The 4x4 truck maneuvers capably, and it takes curves passably well when traveling at a modest speed.<br><br>From both a standstill and while rolling ahead, the Ram 1500's throttle response from the 5.9-liter V-8 is quite vigorous. Automatic-transmission shifts beat the average truck in smoothness. Noise isn't bad, apart from a mild driveline drone.<br><br>Space for two occupants in the regular-cab Ram is abundant, and three adults fit adequately when the immense center armrest/storage box is raised. Space behind the seats is ample enough to be handy. Even with the extra height of a 4x4, climbing aboard isn't terribly difficult.","ItemOption1FieldName":null,"ItemOption1":null,"ItemOption1Required":false,"ItemOption1Type":"SELECT-ONE","ItemOption1Default":null,"ItemOption2FieldName":null,"ItemOption2":null,"ItemOption2Required":false,"ItemOption2Type":"SELECT-ONE","ItemOption2Default":null,"ItemOption3FieldName":null,"ItemOption3":null,"ItemOption3Required":false,"ItemOption3Type":"SELECT-ONE","ItemOption3Default":null,"ItemOption4FieldName":null,"ItemOption4":null,"ItemOption4Required":false,"ItemOption4Type":"SELECT-ONE","ItemOption4Default":null,"ItemOption5FieldName":null,"ItemOption5":null,"ItemOption5Required":false,"ItemOption5Type":"SELECT-ONE","ItemOption5Default":null,"ItemOption6FieldName":null,"ItemOption6":null,"ItemOption6Required":false,"ItemOption6Type":"SELECT-ONE","ItemOption6Default":null,"ItemOption7FieldName":null,"ItemOption7":null,"ItemOption7Required":false,"ItemOption7Type":"SELECT-ONE","ItemOption7Default":null,"ItemImage":"Ram 1500.jpg","ItemImage2":null,"ItemImage3":null,"ItemImage4":null,"ItemImage5":null,"ItemImage6":null,"ItemWeight":0,"ItemCustom":null,"ItemCustom2":null,"ItemCustom3":null,"ItemCustom4":null,"ItemCustom5":null,"ItemCustom6":null,"ItemDisplayOrder":null,"ItemShipping":1.1,"ItemShipping2":1.2,"ItemHandling":1.3,"ItemTax":1.4,"ItemTaxTypeId":1,"ItemShippingTypeId":1,"ItemDiscountTypeId":2,"ItemDownload":"Ram 1500.jpg","ItemCount":-1,"ItemDownloadFn":null,"ItemSelected":true,"ItemCustomName":null,"ItemCustomName2":null,"ItemCustomName3":null,"ItemCustomName4":null,"ItemCustomName5":null,"ItemCustomName6":null,"ItemButtonTypeId":1,"ItemSubscribeA1":0,"ItemSubscribeP1":0,"ItemSubscribeT1":null,"ItemSubscribeA2":0,"ItemSubscribeP2":0,"ItemSubscribeT2":null,"ItemSubscribeA3":0,"ItemSubscribeP3":0,"ItemSubscribeT3":null,"ItemSubscribeRecurring":false,"ItemSubscribeRecurringTimes":0,"ItemSubscribeReattempt":false},{"ItemId":13,"ItemNumber":"GMC 01","ItemName":"Siera Quadrasteer","ItemPrice":13,"ItemDescription":"Quadrasteer four-wheel steering on light-duty, full-size Sierra pickups is new for the 2002 model year.

Five wheelbases are available, which range from 119 to 157.5 inches.<br><br>Club Cab models have two front doors and a pair of narrow back doors that open toward the rear and can't be opened unless the front doors are open.

Regular-cab models come with either a three-place bench seat or a pair of buckets. The Club Cab adds a three-place rear bench that is reclined 18 degrees, making it more comfortable than most rear seats in extended-cab pickups, which tend to be defiantly upright. Sierra 1500 HD Crew Cab pickups seat six occupants.

Two V-8s are optional on 1500 models: a 4.8-liter that makes 270 hp and a 5.3-liter rated at 285 hp. The 5.3-liter V-8 is standard on Sierra 2500 models, and a 300-hp, 6.0-liter V-8 is optional. A five-speed-manual transmission is standard, and a four-speed automatic is optional.<br><br>All Sierra models are available with 4WD, which comes in two forms. Insta-Trac is an on-demand system that allows shifting in and out of 4WD High on the move through a floor-mounted transfer case. Autotrac is an automatically engaging system that sends all of the power to the rear wheels on smooth, dry pavement; on slippery surfaces, it transfers power to the front wheels as needed. Traction control is optional for 2WD models.<br><br>The Sierra 1500 HD Crew Cab pickup can haul a 3,139-pound payload or trailers weighing up to 10,300 pounds. For other models, payloads range from 1,490 to 3,605 pounds. Four-wheel antilock brakes are standard.<br><br><br><br>Driving Impressions<br>Quadrasteer is utterly amazing. Even when driving straight down an expressway, the difference between a regular Sierra and one equipped with Quadrasteer is easily noticeable — and it becomes even more evident when towing a trailer.
