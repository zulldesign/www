   The <I>Ultimate Delicacy</I>, was founded in October of the year two thousand, to fill a gap
   in the Internet world.  This gap was the need for Scott Moore of NOP Design to test the
   NetCharge.com software system, RocketPay, and demo the NOP Design FreeCart shopping cart.  
   This site is a simple facade, and there are no
   products actually for sale.  If you place an order on this site, you will receive only a thank
   you page, and no actual product.
   <P>
   Because Scott believes in only the best for design, this site has been designed to truly
   represent a typical E-Commerce client, and has all of the typical functions.

   I would like to dedicate this site to my wife Amanda, who has taught me more about spelling,

   other such projects.
